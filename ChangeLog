- Add a bindexec command.
- Stop using $TMPDIR as a temporary variable name in cvmfsexec because it
  might be already set and exported.

cvmfsexec-4.46 - 2 April 2025
- Go back to selecting the cvmfs version from the egi and osg distribution.
- Properly sort the cvmfs version number from the downloaded list of packages.
- For osg use 24-main instead of 23-main.
- For suse15 switch to getting some packages from el8 instead of el7.
- Retry rpm downloads up to 3 times if they fail.

cvmfsexec-4.45 - 5 March 2025
- Change to try downloading cvmfs packages from cvmrepo.s3.cern.ch and
  fall back to cvmrepo.web.cern.ch if that doesn't work.

cvmfsexec-4.44 - 5 February 2025
- Add translations in makedist from debian 11 & 12 and ubuntu 22 & 24 to
  rhel8 & rhel9.

cvmfsexec-4.43 - 6 January 2025
- Adjust the URL for downloading osg packages after the layout changed.
- Add the variable SINGCVMFS_LOGDIR to override the location of the
  cvmfs logs.

cvmfsexec-4.42 - 24 September 2024
- Add rhel9-aarch64 and rhel9-ppc64le machine types.
- In makedist help, split machine types from different distributions
  onto different lines.

cvmfsexec-4.41 - 9 September 2024
- Switch to the archive for el7 epel packages.
- Add CI checks on every pull request for a fairly through test of
  all the combinations of modes, distributions, and machine types.

cvmfsexec-4.40 - 5 July 2024
- Switch to vault.centos.org for el7 fuse-libs package.

cvmfsexec-4.39 - 26 January 2024
- Skip installing cvmfs-x509-helper with the "default" configuration.

cvmfsexec-4.38 - 25 January 2024
- Support scitokens with authenticated repositories.
- Switch osg el8 & el9 to use the 23-main repositories instead of 3.6.
- Skip cvmfs-libs if the cvmfs minor version is less than 10.
- Fail when an rpm extraction fails.

cvmfsexec-4.37 - 7 September 2023
- Include the cvmfs-libs rpm in the cvmfs distribution.  The rpm was
  added in cvmfs-2.10.0 and started being required by the cvmfs package
  in cvmfs-2.11.0.

cvmfsexec-4.36 - 5 July 2023
- Fix making rhel8-ppc64le distributions, which was broken in 4.34.

cvmfsexec-4.35 - 21 June 2023
- The previous fix was not actually able to distinguish between -s and
  not -s on el9.  So instead, makedist now always creates a file
  .cvmfsexecdist at the top level which says what type it is, "sing" or
  "standard", and also what the machine type was.  makedist -o requires
  that file only with -s (for now), so anyone with a makedist -s
  distribution will have to remake their distribution if they want to
  use -o.

cvmfsexec-4.34 - 21 June 2023
- Fix makedist -o when cross-building between el9 and non-el9 hosts so
  that it doesn't need to be passed the -m option again to match what
  was given to makedist without -o.  It also was not able to distinguish
  on el9 between distributions that had been made with and without -s.

cvmfsexec-4.33 - 11 June 2023
- Add rhel8-aarch64 machine type.
- Avoid error messages from extra attempted downloads of the fuse2 library
  on the suse15-x86_64 machine type.

cvmfsexec-4.32 - 11 May 2023
- Fix typo in version 4.31 that caused config repo to be ignored.

cvmfsexec-4.31 - 4 May 2023
- Add a `none` distribution type in makedist, for no cvmfs config repo.
- Fix mountrepo for the case where a config repo is not set.
- Fix fuse3-libs package repo on EL8 when building for singcvmfs.

cvmfsexec-4.30 - 6 February 2023
- Fix rhel9 support in makedist -o.

cvmfsexec-4.29 - 6 February 2023
- Add support for machine type rhel9-x86_64 in makedist.

cvmfsexec-4.28 - 21 December 2022
- Fix a bug in the code handling inaccessible binds, introduced in 4.26.
- Change rpm downloads to all use https
- Change the source of the fuse3-libs on el8 for makedist -s to be alma8
  instead of epel7, now that the version is updated there to be new enough.

cvmfsexec-4.27 - 2 November 2022
- Set X509_USER_PROXY and/or BEARER_TOKEN_FILE if they are not set,
  because the cvmfs authorization helper runs under the fake root user
  and so it by default looks at the 0 id instead of the user's id.

cvmfsexec-4.26 - 1 November 2022
- Skip binding in something from the host if it is inaccessible.
  Previously cvmfsexec assumed it was a file, but it could be an
  inaccessible directory and cause a bind mount failure.

cvmfsexec-4.25 - 28 September 2022
- Set APPTAINER_BINDPATH in addition to SINGULARITY_BINDPATH in singcvmfs
  for supporting apptainer.
- Add support in singcvmfs for using an ext3 image file for the cvmfs cache.
  (Note: for this, non-setuid apptainer 1.1.0 requires the /var/lib/cvmfs
  directory to be pre-created in the image).

cvmfsexec-4.24 - 7 September 2022
- Fix makedist of suse machine type; the libfuse2 download link had an extra
  "Details" reference on the end that was confusing it.
- Make makedist of rhel8-ppc64le work again.  It was broken by update in 4.22.
- Use a unique name for each copr repo referenced, because otherwise
  yumdownloader's caching gets confused.
- Remove makedist support for rhel6 machine type.

cvmfsexec-4.23 - 19 August 2022
- Fix bug with cvmfsexec mode 2, on an older RHEL 7 kernel where USERFUSE
  gets set to false, that caused repositories to be unmounted early if the
  -N option was used.

cvmfsexec-4.22 - 18 July 2022
- Update the download URL for suse15, the old one doesn't work anymore
- Put a more explicit message in as to why rhel8 does not work with egi
- Remove old fallback code for osg rhel8 to download from osg-testing repo

cvmfsexec-4.21 - 7 July 2022
- Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH for fuse2fs to find libfuse from the dist directory.
- Get rid of fuse2fs warnings by waiting for clean unmount when possible,
  and by instructing to create the filesystem without a journal.

cvmfsexec-4.20 - 7 July 2022
- Add `-m` option to mount a scratch filesystem with fuse2fs.

cvmfsexec-4.19 - 23 June 2022
- Add rhel8-ppc64le supported type in makedist.  Does not include support
  for authenticated mounts because of no cvmfs-x509-helper.
- Switch to Almalinux for rhel8-x86_64 fuse-libs (because Rocky doesn't
  have ppc64le) in makedist
- Have makedist abort with clear error if not using one of the supported
  machine types

cvmfsexec-4.18 - 10 April 2022
- Change makedist osg to use osg3.6 instead of osg3.5

cvmfsexec-4.17 - 10 February 2022
- Change makedist on el8 to download from Rocky Linux repository instead
  of CentOS.  Also add el9 to download from CentOS 9 Stream.

cvmfsexec-4.16 - 21 December 2021
- Change that to /proc/driver, not /proc/device

cvmfsexec-4.15 - 16 December 2021
- Avoid using new pid namespace also if /proc/device is mounted, as
  happens under docker with --gpus

cvmfsexec-4.14 - 17 August 2021
- Exclude 32bit fuse library from suse distribution

cvmfsexec-4.13 - 17 August 2021
- Change mountrepo to edit directory names starting with /var first, in
  case the working directory begins with /var.

cvmfsexec-4.12 - 15 June 2021
- Change mountrepo to avoid editing directory names that begin with "/cvmfs"
  but are longer, for example if someone names something "/cvmfsexec".
- Suport mounting ligo.osgstorage.org.  (Also needs changes in config
  repo and updates to cvmfs that are now in nightly builds and will be
  in cvmfs-2.8.2).

cvmfsexec-4.11 - 3 May 2021
- Complete the implementation of -N by closing CVMFSEXEC_CMDFD.
- Avoid hangs when using -N while systempaths are masked.

cvmfsexec-4.10 - 29 April 2021
- Add -N option.

cvmfsexec-4.9 - 28 April 2021
- Fix bug introduced in 4.7 that caused mountrepo inside of cvmfsexec to
  hang after mounting.
- Prevent mountrepo inside of cvmfsexec from hanging if CVMFSEXEC_CMDFD
  is closed.

cvmfsexec-4.8 - 23 April 2021
- When /proc is masked, wait for cleanup to happen before exiting.

cvmfsexec-4.7 - 23 March 2021
- Check the return code of mount /proc in cvmfsexec and exit immediately
  with a helpful message if it fails.
- When /proc is "masked" like in the default settings of docker and
  kubernetes, do not use a separate pid namespace and instead cleanly
  unmount all the repositories before exiting.
- If running as fake root inside of umountrepo use umount instead of
  fusermount -u.

cvmfsexec-4.6 - 5 February 2021
- Add support for instance commands to singcvmfs.  Contributed by Ben
  Tovar.

cvmfsexec-4.5 - 28 October 2020
- Implement fill "source" processing of config files in mountrepo, to
  handle the double sourcing of files recently introduced in the OSG
  configuration repository.
- Change cvmfsexec to properly return error codes from mountrepo.

cvmfsexec-4.4 - 13 August 2020
- Add support for suse to makedist.
- Add makedist -m machinetype option to make distributions for
  non-native machine types.
- Make sure /usr/sbin is in the cvmfsexec PATH, for finding pivot_root.
- Prevent cvmfsexec from exiting until repositories are unmounted.

cvmfsexec-4.3 - 23 June 2020
- Have makedist -o and mountrepo also look for fuse library in dist/lib* in
    order to support el6.
- Order default WPAD servers to prioritize fnal for osg and cern for
    other distributions.

cvmfsexec-4.2 - 1 June 2020
- In singcvmfs when cvmfs debugging is enabled, also save the initial
    output of cvmfs2 in the debug log file.
- On osg el8, get rpms from testing yum repository if they're missing 
    from the release repository.

cvmfsexec-4.1 - 4 May 2020
- Change makedist -s to make sure cvmfs-fuse3 exists
- Include cvmfs2-wrapper in makedist -s -o self-extracting script

cvmfsexec-4.0 - 1 May 2020
- Change singcvmfs to directly pass commands that start with exec, run,
    shell, or version to singularity, so it can be used as a drop-in
    replacement for singularity.  When used in this mode, $SINGCVMFS_IMAGE
    is not required.
- Change $SINGCVMFS_LOGLEVEL to only apply to cvmfs debugging.  Instead,
    singularity debugging along with any other singularity global option
    can be passed directly on the command line before the command.
- Change the -v option of singcvmfs that reported its version to -V.
- Change the name of $SINGCVMFS_CVMFSOPTSFILE to $SINGCVMFS_OPTSFILE.
- Change the extraction directory for a self-extracting singcvmfs
    made by makedist -s -o to be .singcvmfs instead of $HOME/.singcvmfs

cvmfsexec-3.2 - 29 April 2020
- Change makedist without -s (that is, for cvmfsexec) to include fuse-libs
    for systems that do not have it.
- Change makedist to turn symlinks with full path targets into relative
    paths.  This was preventing singcvmfs from working on systems that
    didn't already have cvmfs installed.
- Remove the cvmfs mounting messages in singcvmfs that otherwise start
    happening with singularity-3.6.
- Change singcvmfs to send syslog messages to log/<reponame>.log.
- Add SINGCVMFS_LOGLEVEL=debug which enables debugging for singularity &
    cvmfs.  The cvmfs debug messages go to log/<reponame>-debug.log.

cvmfsexec-3.1 - 15 April 2020
- Change makedist to fail with better error messages when it can't 
    download packages it needs.
- Change makedist -s to download fuse3 from EPEL7 when on RHEL8, because
    the RHEL8.1 fuse3 version is too old and the fact that it moved to
    the base OS caused it to be removed from EPEL8.
- Change makedist to exclude .build-id files.
- Add "http://grid-wpad/wpad.dat;http://wpad/wpad.dat" to the beginning
    of the default Proxy Auto Config URLs.
- Change singcvmfs to set CVMFS_NFILES in a default.d config file, to
    avoid showing a cvmfs warning with singularity >= 3.6.

cvmfsexec-3.0 - 10 April 2020
- Add singcvmfs command and makedist -s option.
- Support unprivileged namespace fuse mounts in cvmfsexec on RHEL 7.8.

cvmfsexec-2.6 - 30 March 2020
- Avoid relocating OASIS_CERTIFICATES variable in oasis.opensciencegrid.org.

cvmfsexec-2.5 - 24 March 2020
- Exclude cvmfs-x509-helper-debug in makedist.

cvmfsexec-2.4 - 23 March 2020
- Add support in mountrepo for ". ../" in config files, as it is used in
    the EGI config repository for reading common.conf.

cvmfsexec-2.3 - 23 December 2019
- Fix support of cvmfs-2.7.0 by using its new CVMFS_LIBRARY_PATH.

cvmfsexec-2.2 - 4 December 2019
- allow multiple settings of CVMFS_CONFIG_REPOSITORY in default.d files.

cvmfsexec-2.1 - 9 October 2019
- Direct logs to per-repository files in "log" directory instead of syslog.
- Add makedist -o option to create one self-extracting script with the
    cvmfs distribution and cvmfsexec tools.

cvmfsexec-2.0 - 7 October 2019
- Take advantage of user namespace fuse mounts on kernels >= 4.18 (CentOS 8).
    This enables cleaning up mountpoints even with kill -9.
- Replace the $CVMFSEXEC interface with a simpler $CVMFSMOUNT/$CVMFSUMOUNT
    interface that also leaves no extra processes in the process tree.
- Always use --rbind instead of --bind when doing underlay mounts.
- Add cvmfs-x509-helper in makedist when it is present.

cvmfsexec-1.1 - 12 September 2019
- Preserve whitespace in parameters.
- Enable adding additional mounted repositories by invoking $CVMFSEXEC.
- Don't attempt to mount repositories that are already mounted.
