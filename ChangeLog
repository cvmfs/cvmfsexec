- Fix makedist of suse machine type; the libfuse2 download link had an extra
  "Details" reference on the end that was confusing it.
- Remove makedist support for rhel6 machine type.

cvmfsexec-4.23 - 19 August 2022
- Fix bug with cvmfsexec mode 2, on an older RHEL 7 kernel where USERFUSE
  gets set to false, that caused repositories to be unmounted early if the
  -N option was used.

cvmfsexec-4.22 - 18 July 2022
- Update the download URL for suse15, the old one doesn't work anymore
- Put a more explicit message in as to why rhel8 does not work with egi
- Remove old fallback code for osg rhel8 to download from osg-testing repo

cvmfsexec-4.21 - 7 July 2022
- Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH for fuse2fs to find libfuse from the dist directory.
- Get rid of fuse2fs warnings by waiting for clean unmount when possible,
  and by instructing to create the filesystem without a journal.

cvmfsexec-4.20 - 7 July 2022
- Add `-m` option to mount a scratch filesystem with fuse2fs.

cvmfsexec-4.19 - 23 June 2022
- Add rhel8-ppc64le supported type in makedist.  Does not include support
  for authenticated mounts because of no cvmfs-x509-helper.
- Switch to Almalinux for rhel8-x86_64 fuse-libs (because Rocky doesn't
  have ppc64le) in makedist
- Have makedist abort with clear error if not using one of the supported
  machine types

cvmfsexec-4.18 - 10 April 2022
- Change makedist osg to use osg3.6 instead of osg3.5

cvmfsexec-4.17 - 10 February 2022

  of CentOS.  Also add el9 to download from CentOS 9 Stream.

- Change that to /proc/driver, not /proc/device

cvmfsexec-4.15 - 16 December 2021

cvmfsexec-4.13 - 17 August 2021
- Change mountrepo to edit directory names starting with /var first, in
  case the working directory begins with /var.

cvmfsexec-4.12 - 15 June 2021
- Change mountrepo to avoid editing directory names that begin with "/cvmfs"
  but are longer, for example if someone names something "/cvmfsexec".
- Suport mounting ligo.osgstorage.org.  (Also needs changes in config
  repo and updates to cvmfs that are now in nightly builds and will be
  in cvmfs-2.8.2).

cvmfsexec-4.11 - 3 May 2021
- Complete the implementation of -N by closing CVMFSEXEC_CMDFD.
- Avoid hangs when using -N while systempaths are masked.

cvmfsexec-4.10 - 29 April 2021

- Fix bug introduced in 4.7 that caused mountrepo inside of cvmfsexec to
  hang after mounting.
- Prevent mountrepo inside of cvmfsexec from hanging if CVMFSEXEC_CMDFD
  is closed.

cvmfsexec-4.7 - 23 March 2021
- Check the return code of mount /proc in cvmfsexec and exit immediately
  with a helpful message if it fails.
- When /proc is "masked" like in the default settings of docker and
  kubernetes, do not use a separate pid namespace and instead cleanly
  unmount all the repositories before exiting.
- If running as fake root inside of umountrepo use umount instead of
  fusermount -u.

cvmfsexec-4.6 - 5 February 2021
- Add support for instance commands to singcvmfs.  Contributed by Ben
  Tovar.

cvmfsexec-4.5 - 28 October 2020
- Implement fill "source" processing of config files in mountrepo, to
  handle the double sourcing of files recently introduced in the OSG
  configuration repository.
- Change cvmfsexec to properly return error codes from mountrepo.

cvmfsexec-4.4 - 13 August 2020
- Add support for suse to makedist.
- Add makedist -m machinetype option to make distributions for
  non-native machine types.
- Make sure /usr/sbin is in the cvmfsexec PATH, for finding pivot_root.
- Prevent cvmfsexec from exiting until repositories are unmounted.

cvmfsexec-4.3 - 23 June 2020

    order to support el6.
- Order default WPAD servers to prioritize fnal for osg and cern for
    other distributions.

cvmfsexec-4.2 - 1 June 2020

    output of cvmfs2 in the debug log file.
- On osg el8, get rpms from testing yum repository if they're missing 
    from the release repository.

cvmfsexec-4.1 - 4 May 2020
- Change makedist -s to make sure cvmfs-fuse3 exists
- Include cvmfs2-wrapper in makedist -s -o self-extracting script

cvmfsexec-4.0 - 1 May 2020
- Change singcvmfs to directly pass commands that start with exec, run,
    shell, or version to singularity, so it can be used as a drop-in
    replacement for singularity.  When used in this mode, $SINGCVMFS_IMAGE
    is not required.
- Change $SINGCVMFS_LOGLEVEL to only apply to cvmfs debugging.  Instead,
    singularity debugging along with any other singularity global option
    can be passed directly on the command line before the command.
- Change the -v option of singcvmfs that reported its version to -V.
- Change the name of $SINGCVMFS_CVMFSOPTSFILE to $SINGCVMFS_OPTSFILE.
- Change the extraction directory for a self-extracting singcvmfs
    made by makedist -s -o to be .singcvmfs instead of $HOME/.singcvmfs

cvmfsexec-3.2 - 29 April 2020
- Change makedist without -s (that is, for cvmfsexec) to include fuse-libs
    for systems that do not have it.
- Change makedist to turn symlinks with full path targets into relative
    paths.  This was preventing singcvmfs from working on systems that
    didn't already have cvmfs installed.
- Remove the cvmfs mounting messages in singcvmfs that otherwise start
    happening with singularity-3.6.
- Change singcvmfs to send syslog messages to log/<reponame>.log.
- Add SINGCVMFS_LOGLEVEL=debug which enables debugging for singularity &
    cvmfs.  The cvmfs debug messages go to log/<reponame>-debug.log.

cvmfsexec-3.1 - 15 April 2020
- Change makedist to fail with better error messages when it can't 
    download packages it needs.
- Change makedist -s to download fuse3 from EPEL7 when on RHEL8, because
    the RHEL8.1 fuse3 version is too old and the fact that it moved to
    the base OS caused it to be removed from EPEL8.
- Change makedist to exclude .build-id files.
- Add "http://grid-wpad/wpad.dat;http://wpad/wpad.dat" to the beginning
    of the default Proxy Auto Config URLs.
- Change singcvmfs to set CVMFS_NFILES in a default.d config file, to
    avoid showing a cvmfs warning with singularity >= 3.6.

cvmfsexec-3.0 - 10 April 2020
- Add singcvmfs command and makedist -s option.
- Support unprivileged namespace fuse mounts in cvmfsexec on RHEL 7.8.

- Exclude cvmfs-x509-helper-debug in makedist.

cvmfsexec-2.4 - 23 March 2020
- Add support in mountrepo for ". ../" in config files, as it is used in
    the EGI config repository for reading common.conf.

cvmfsexec-2.3 - 23 December 2019
- Fix support of cvmfs-2.7.0 by using its new CVMFS_LIBRARY_PATH.

cvmfsexec-2.2 - 4 December 2019
- allow multiple settings of CVMFS_CONFIG_REPOSITORY in default.d files.

cvmfsexec-2.1 - 9 October 2019
- Direct logs to per-repository files in "log" directory instead of syslog.
- Add makedist -o option to create one self-extracting script with the
    cvmfs distribution and cvmfsexec tools.

cvmfsexec-2.0 - 7 October 2019
- Take advantage of user namespace fuse mounts on kernels >= 4.18 (CentOS 8).
    This enables cleaning up mountpoints even with kill -9.
- Replace the $CVMFSEXEC interface with a simpler $CVMFSMOUNT/$CVMFSUMOUNT
    interface that also leaves no extra processes in the process tree.
- Always use --rbind instead of --bind when doing underlay mounts.
- Add cvmfs-x509-helper in makedist when it is present.

cvmfsexec-1.1 - 12 September 2019
- Preserve whitespace in parameters.
- Enable adding additional mounted repositories by invoking $CVMFSEXEC.
